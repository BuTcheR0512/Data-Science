# Data-Science -Camb.Ai
My pc was not working and is in service centre so I completed this in GOOGLE COLLAB .

Firstly I had to figure out what was expected from me in this challenge and then to workup on it.

Install the necessary Libraries required. 

Data Collection:

  1-I download the YT Irish language video by running a query and limiting the max result to 2.

Data Preprocessing:

  1- extracted the audio and subtile file from it using youtube api. 

  2- Properly encoded the audio files.

  3- I then auto aligned the audio files and the transcript in a folder.

Data Augmentation:

 1- Then I augmented the data with some other variances to make dataset more robust.

Dataset Creation:

  1- Then ran a frequency test to check if a speaker is male or female.(It may not be the prefect way but can be considered)
